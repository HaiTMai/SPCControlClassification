# SPCControlClassification
StatisticalProcess Control (SPC) charts also known as Shewhartcharts have been used widely in many processes. However, with so many control charts in manufacturing processes, process engineers find the difficulty to interpret/classify control charts into the specific categories. Several attempts have been made to classify control charts automatically but there is still a room for higher recognition accuracy. This paper demonstrates how effectively support vector machines as supervised learning can be used in SPC Control Chart classification. However, in reality, labeled data always is limited and expensive whereas unlabeled data is obviously cheap and available. In this study, we also present a new approach to classify control chart using Label Spreading as semi-supervised learning for unlabeled data.
